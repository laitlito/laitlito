# Welcome to my GitHub page ! 👋

Hi, I'm Lélio, currently in my fourth year at [Polytech Nice Sophia Antipolis](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr/), majoring in [applied mathematics and modeling specialisation](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/formation/offre-de-formation/ingenieur-mathematiques-appliquees-et-modelisation). I mainly like to work on real-life problems such as maximising or minimising things to make other work.


## About me

- 🚀 Currently in the 4th year of engineering school.
- 💡 I like to learn about new methods to solve complex problems.
- 🎹 Average classical music enjoyer (🗿), I'm most dedicated to Chopin and Liszt. I've been playing for 15 years now.
- 🏅 I have been into sports my whole life. Here's the 5 sports I like doing best : swimming, badminton, football, tennis and volleyball
- 🎮 I really enjoy highly competitive video games and niche ones
   - Reached highest rank in Fortnite (Chapter 5 season 1)
   - Top 500 best players osu! in France
   - Top 50 Europe players of Paladins in 2020
   - Top 1 bedwars players on Rinaorc in June 2021
- 🇯🇵 I love japanese culture and anime in general (studo Ghibli, studio Pierrot, ...)

## Skills

- 💻 Programming languages ordered by fluency: 
   - Python
   - Java
   - Julia
   - C/C++
   - SQL
   - Matlab
- 🛠️ Technologies that interest me : High end computer components, mathematical research, optimisation, PDEs and ODEs.
- 🐧 Current setup : I am currently running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, and about to become a (perhaps a little too much) proud Arch Linux user.

## Most proud-of projects

Here are some projects I contributed to or did by myself :

- [Optimal allocation of bacterial resources in a bioreactor](https://github.com/pns-mam/batch) - Solving an Optimal Control Problem in Julia on maximising the volume of a bacteria.
- [Lotka-Volterra models](https://github.com/laitlito/LotkaVolterraPreyPredator) - Prey-predator model proposed by Lotka-Volterra in 1925-1926 implemented in Python.
- [Simple image processing software](https://github.com/laitlito/TraitementImage) - A java code to apply transformations on images such as convolution matrices for example.
